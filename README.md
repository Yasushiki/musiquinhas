# musiquinhas

## What is?
musiquinhas is a simple game inspired by a video that I saw on Instragram. You'll have to rank 5 random songs, but you don't know what the next song is and you can't change your choice.

## Usage
### building
Just clone the repository and run ```bundle install```. After all the gems are installed, run ```ruby main.rb```

### database
The "urls" (actually, it's just the url tokens) are in ```public/url``` file, you can create another file with your custom urls and change the path in ```main.rb```

### "features"
You can reset the ranking or skip to the next song
